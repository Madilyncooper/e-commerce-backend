# e-commerce-backend

The backend for a potential e-commerce site. This backend includes all route handlers, a working database, and tables within that database. All the information in the database is able to be viewed and manipulated through different api routes. 


## Motivation

E-commerce is one of the largest money making machines today. Any company would benefit from having all of their products available through the internet. The best way to keep track of it all is through a malleable database that can be updated/changed/deleted/viewed through things the user might do on the front end of the application, if it were created.
